# 361-Group20-Project

Feel free to place any important notes here.

11/16 (Charles):  I've updated the script files for the pages we've drafted.  I moved them to the public folder because that's the 
  designated "static" folder and if I remember right, they need to be there to execute.
  I also included basic xml http requests in two of the scripts.  May need modification.  Can someone draft request handlers/queries?
  Maybe before we do that, though, we should sort out the issue of what attributes the user will have.  Please see the issue
  I posted on that.
